/*-
 * Description:
 *   Create an interface MessageDecoder that has a single abstract method
 *     decode(cipherText), where cipherText is the message to be decoded.
 *     The method will return the decoded message. Modify the classes
 *     SubstitutionCipher and ShuffleCipher, as described in Programming
 *     Problem 2, above, so that they implement MessageDecoder as well as
 *     the interface MessageEncoder described above. Finally, write a program
 *     that allows a user to encode and decode messages
 *     entered on the keyboard.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   - TODO
 *
 * Pseudocode:
 *   1. TODO
