/*-
 * Description:
 *   Create an abstract class PayCalculator that has an attribute
 *     payRate given in dollars per hour. The class should also have a method
 *     computePay(hours) that returns the pay for a given amount of time.
 *
 *   Derive a class RegularPay from PayCalculator, as described above. It
 *     should have a constructor that has a parameter for the pay rate. It
 *     should not override any of the methods. Then derive a class HazardPay
 *     from PayCalculator that overrides the computePay method. The new method
 *     should return the amount returned by the base class method
 *     multiplied by 1.5.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   - payRate is a double
 *   - computePay returns a double
 *   - no need for accessor/modifier methods for payRate
 *
 * Pseudocode:
 *   1. create a class with a single method
