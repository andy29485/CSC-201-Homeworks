 * Description:
 *   The pledge of Allegiance states, "I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the
 *     United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands: one
 *     Nation under God, indivisible, With Liberty and Justice for all."
 *     Save the pledge, 174 characters, to a text file. Use the
 *     RandomAccessFile class to access the file.Â Using Seek method, display
 *     the characters at positions 124 and 135 only.
 *
 *   Directions:
 *     - Create a text file with the pledge of allegiance named
 *         Pledge.txt using notepad.
 *     - Create a reference to the file, Pledge.txt, using the
 *         RandomAccessFile class.
 *     - Use the Seek method to point at positions 124 and 135, then display
 *         the characters represented by the byte streams.
 *     - Use try, catch and finally blocks for exception handling.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   - I do not have to use notepad to create the file as GNU/Linux does not
 *       natively run notepad
 *   - Pledge.txt can be lowercase (I perfer lowercase file names)
 *
 * Pseudocode:
 *   1. TODO
