/*-
 * Description:
 *   Write an application which will write five student ID numbers and GPAs
 *     to a "rw" file called "Stu.dat" and then allow you to display the GPA
 *     of any student upon entering their ID number, for any number
 *     of students.
 *
 *   Directions
 *     - Import the classes necessary to support your application.
 *     - Create a class called ReadWrite.Â  This class has no properties or
 *         behaviors.
 *     - Create a main method which will include the following:
 *       - Add an appropriate throws statement in the main method.
 *       - Create a reference to a text file called "Stu.dat" with "rw" access.
 *       - Include try and catch blocks for exception handling.
 *       - Use a loop to interactively assign student ID numbers and their GPA
 *           scores.
 *       - With the use of a second loop, display the GPA for specific student
 *           ID numbers.
 *       - Use a sentinel to determine when you wish to stop the program.
 *       - Include a finally block within your program.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   - Stu.dat can be lowercase (I prefer lowercase filenames)
 *
 * Pseudocode:
 *   1. TODO
