/*-
 * Description:
 *   Revisit the Cycle class in Unit 3.
 *   Modify your application such that the properties will
 *     be written to a text file called "CycleOut.txt" instead of
 *     to the screen.   
 *
 *   - Examine your application for the class called Cycle.
 *   - Add an appropriate throws statement in the main method.
 *   - Create a reference to a File class with the appropriate name of a text
 *     file (Cycle.txt).
 *   - Use appropriate code to ensure that the text file exist.
 *   - Output the values of the variables to the text file.
 *   - Close the file.
 *
 *   Note: Verify the contents were written to the text file using notepad
 *         (or any word processor).
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   - "Word Processor" means Text Editor
 *   - File IO will *NOT* be achieved through piping
 *
 * Pseudocode:
 *   1. TODO
