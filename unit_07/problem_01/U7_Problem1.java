/*-
 * Description:
 *   Revisit the Cycle class in Unit 3.10.1.
 *   Modify your application such that the properties, numberOfWheels and
 *     weight are entered as double values interactively (at the keyboard).
 *     Exception handling will be used to determine whether a type mismatch
 *     occurs.
 *
 *   Edit your application such that, in addition to [A], the values
 *     for numberOfWheels and weight, entered interactively, will throw
 *     a new exception “Values cannot be less than or equal to zero” only
 *     If the values are less than or equal to zero.  Add or use the
 *     appropriate try and/or catch blocks.
 *
 *   - Examine your application for the class called Cycle.
 *   - Add Try and Catch blocks appropriately.
 *   - Add the throw statement for the new exception.
 *   - Display an appropriate message if an exception occurs.
 *   - Display the properties of the object.
 *
 *   Note: Verify the contents were written to the text file using notepad
 *         (or any word processor).
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   - "Word Processor" means Text Editor
 *   - File IO will *NOT* be achieved through piping
 *
 * Pseudocode:
 *   1. TODO
